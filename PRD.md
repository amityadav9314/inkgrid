# Technical Architecture and Stack Analysis
After analyzing the technology options mentioned, here is the recommended stack with justification:

## Backend Recommendation: Golang with Gin Framework
    Rationale:

    Superior performance for image processing compared to Python/Django

    Excellent concurrency handling for processing multiple images simultaneously

    Lower memory footprint than Java Spring Boot

    Statically typed language reducing runtime errors

    Faster compilation and execution times

    While Python Django offers simpler development and Java Spring Boot provides a mature ecosystem, Golang's performance advantages are critical for the image-intensive processing required for mosaic generation.

## Frontend Recommendation: React Native with Expo
    Rationale:

    Achieves the "write once, run everywhere" requirement

    Expo platform simplifies deployment across iOS, Android, and web

    Better native performance than PWA approaches

    Supports desktop through Electron integration

    Unified codebase reduces maintenance overhead

    Large component ecosystem for UI elements

    This approach allows true cross-platform development while maintaining native performance where it matters most.

## Image Processing: Sharp library with ImageMagick fallback
    Rationale:

    Sharp offers superior performance for Node.js/JavaScript environments

    Native bindings provide significant speed advantages over pure JS solutions

    ImageMagick as fallback for complex operations

    Better cross-platform support than pure ImageMagick

    Active maintenance and optimization for modern systems

## Database: PostgreSQL
    Rationale:

    Robust support for image metadata

    Efficient blob storage for user projects

    Strong performance for concurrent operations

    Excellent integration with Golang

## Infrastructure Recommendations:
    Containerized deployment using Docker
    Cloud storage integration for user files (AWS S3 or equivalent)
    CDN for fast image delivery
    Serverless functions for on-demand processing of large images
